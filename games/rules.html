                - The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.<br>
                - In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.<br>
                - BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.<br>
                - The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.<br>
                - The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
